# Dog Adoption Assistant 

## Description
An application that will assist prospective dog owners in being matched to a dog breed based on one question quiz regarding their favorite food. The quiz question will have 5 choices resulting in 5 potential popular dog breeds. User will then be presented with a picture of the breed and some facts about the breed. The user will be prompted to enter their zipcode to create a list of local shelters to them. Client-side storage will be utilized for the user to revisit previous breed matching results.

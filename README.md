Dog Adoption Assistant 

We are building an application that will assist prospective dog owners decided which breed is right for them by choosing from one of five options. Each option, when selected, will display a specific dog breed to the user. Once the breed is displayed, the user is then prompted to enter their ZIP code. When the ZIP code is entered, a list of local animal shelters/adoption centers is displayed. The application utilizes two web-based APIs: the Dogs API, based on the Stanford Dogs Dataset, was used for the stock pictures for each breed, and Adopt-A-Pet was used to find and display local animal shelters.
